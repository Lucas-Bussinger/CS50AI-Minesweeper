# Minesweeper AI
## What it does
This project uses Conjunt bases AI to base it's decisions
If no information if provided, it does not know what to do, thus the decision is random 
( see the video at 2:00 ), where the AI starts the round, knowing nothing about the field, 
and end up chosing a mine, losing the game )

But if Information is provided, the decisions are all made based on this information,
in this Minesweeper case, infering where are safe cells or dangerous celss
